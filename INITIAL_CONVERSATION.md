Based on the Claude Code documentation, I'll create a proper slash command that follows the official patterns for documentation generation. Here's the implementation:[documentation-slash-command.py]

Now, let me create a more integrated version using hooks as described in the Claude Code documentation:[claude-code-documentation-hooks.py]

Finally, here's the complete slash command implementation following Claude Code's patterns:

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive Claude Code slash command `/doc-last` that follows the official documentation patterns. Here's what it provides:

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic File Detection**:
   - Detects files modified in the last git commit
   - Falls back to unstaged changes
   - Can also find recently modified files (last 5 minutes)
   - Supports JS, TS, Python, Java, Go, and Rust files

2. **Smart Analysis**:
   - Checks if files need documentation
   - Counts undocumented functions
   - Identifies missing JSDoc/docstrings

3. **Comprehensive Documentation Generation**:
   - Generates JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Creates docstrings for Python
   - Updates module documentation
   - Updates project-wide docs (README, API, CHANGELOG)

4. **Tracking and Reporting**:
   - Creates a documentation report with checkboxes
   - Tracks progress of documentation tasks
   - Provides clear next steps

### Installation:

1. Create the command directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   ```

2. Save the script as `.claude/commands/doc-last`:
   ```bash
   # Copy the script to the file
   chmod +x .claude/commands/doc-last
   ```

3. Use the command after making code changes:
   ```bash
   /doc-last
   ```

### Optional Hook System:

The hook system (second artifact) can automatically detect when files need documentation after each command and suggest running `/doc-last`.

This implementation follows Claude Code's best practices for:
- Clear, informative output
- Comprehensive documentation generation
- Integration with existing workflows
- Tracking and reporting capabilities

The command will analyze your recently modified files and generate appropriate documentation following your project's patterns, making it easy to maintain high-quality documentation alongside your code changes.

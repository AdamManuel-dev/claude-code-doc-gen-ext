### 3. Implement git-based file detection  
**Completed:** 2025-01-25  
**Original TODO:** üî¥ Implement git-based file detection (M) - Get files from last commit

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added `is_git_repository()` function to check if current directory is a git repo
- Implemented `get_git_changed_files()` that:
  - Gets files from last commit using `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`
  - Also checks unstaged changes with `git diff --name-only`
  - Includes staged changes with `git diff --cached --name-only`
  - Filters results by supported extensions (.js, .ts, .py, etc.)
  - Removes duplicates and verifies files exist
- Integrated file detection into main workflow with verbose output

**Files Changed:**
- Updated: `.claude/commands/doc-last`

**Tests Added:** None (manual testing performed)

**Follow-up Tasks:** None

### 4. Add time-based detection fallback
**Completed:** 2025-01-25  
**Original TODO:** üü° Add time-based detection fallback (S) - Find files modified in last 5 minutes

**Implementation Summary:**
- Implemented `get_recently_modified_files()` function that:
  - Searches current directory and subdirectories
  - Finds files modified in the last 5 minutes (configurable)
  - Skips hidden directories
  - Filters by supported extensions
  - Returns relative paths for consistency
- Integrated as fallback when:
  - Not in a git repository
  - No git changes found
- Provides seamless experience regardless of git status

**Files Changed:**
- Updated: `.claude/commands/doc-last`

**Tests Added:** None (manual testing with test_file.js)

**Follow-up Tasks:** 
- Consider making time window configurable via CLI argument

### 5. Create simple function detector
**Completed:** 2025-01-25  
**Original TODO:** üî¥ Create simple function detector (M) - Regex-based function/class detection

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created `FunctionInfo` class to store function metadata
- Implemented `detect_javascript_functions()` that detects:
  - Function declarations (including async and exported)
  - Arrow functions
  - Class declarations
  - Class methods
  - Checks for existing JSDoc comments
- Implemented `detect_python_functions()` that detects:
  - Function definitions
  - Class definitions  
  - Class methods (differentiated by indentation)
  - Checks for existing docstrings
- Created `analyze_file()` wrapper that:
  - Selects appropriate detector based on file extension
  - Returns comprehensive analysis with counts

**Files Changed:**
- Updated: `.claude/commands/doc-last`

**Tests Added:** None (manual testing with test_file.js and test_file.py)
